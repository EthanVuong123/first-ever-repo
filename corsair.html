    <h1>CORSAIR</h1>
    <p>As an Event Specialist Intern at CORSAIR I worked under the trade marketing team to help create meaningful events that showcased CORSAIR's extensive product line. I was given the opportunity to spearhead the planning process for The Best Buy Leadership Meeting, a B2B tradeshow with 1,500 attendees, and Gamescon 2023, a B2C convention with 300,000 attendees. I also created designs for new merchandise and apparel alongside the design team.</p>
    <p>Before I was an intern, I represented CORSAIR as a student ambassador at UCR! Throughout the year I generated awareness to the brand through activations such as tabling and tournaments.​</p>
