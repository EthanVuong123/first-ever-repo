    <h2>Highlander Gaming</h2>
    <p>Highlander Gaming is UCR's premier gaming and esports club. During my time building the club from the ground up after covid, I planned a multitude of events to bridge a connection between gamers on campus that expanded beyond a computer screen. This included tabling sessions, online and in-person socials, professional development nights, cosplay contests, and full conventions. My proudest accomplishment was successfully hosting HighlanderCon, a day-long convention in our main HUB building that connected over 1,000 gaming enthusiasts.</p>
