    <h1>Associated Students Program Board</h1>
    <p>In my final year at UCR, I broadened my horizens and joined my school's program board as an Events Intern. Here I was able to gain insight on the entertainment industry and open myself up to a new forms of events. My proudest achievements were hosting my school's concerts throughout the year: Block Party, Winter Odyssey, and Spring Splash. These concerts had over 6,000 students in attendance and taught me skills such as guest services, vendor outreach, and line/safety management! </p>
