    <h1>American Campus Communities</h1>
    <p>As a Community Assistant, I aligned myself in the Hospitality Industry and aimed to create a welcoming environment for the residents at North District. I planned floor and apartment-wide programs such as socials, movie nights, professional development nights, and even a Thanksgiving dinner for residents who weren't able to go home during the holidays! At ACC I was also given the opportunity to grow my administrative skills through front-desk duties such as answering inqueries, navigating lease agreements, filing mail, and answering/transferring incoming phone calls. All in all, this experience helped me further develop my customer service skills and insight towards how to run a business. </p>
